- name: Ozei
  description: My team's final project for our bootcamp. Ozei is a fullstack mobile facing application that connects large groups of people with reservations at restaurants instantaneously! Users can search for real restaurants in Tokyo (provided by the Hot Pepper API) and send requests for a reservation. Owners of restaurants can use the app to either approve or deny reservations as well. As project manager, I was responsible for setting up the APIs (Hotpepper and Mapbox), assisting with backend, and doing some workin Javascript on the front end.
